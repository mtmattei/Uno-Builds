# Design Graph Ontology v0.1

The v0.1 ontology is deliberately small. Expand it only when repeated eval failures demonstrate a missing concept.

## Node types

### `screen`

A top-level user-visible view, page, window, route surface, or major navigable UI.

Examples:
- Settings
- Orders
- Dashboard

Do not create separate screens for loading/error/empty presentations of the same conceptual screen when they are states.

### `region`

A meaningful structural area inside a screen/component.

Examples:
- navigation rail;
- account section;
- toolbar;
- content region;
- footer.

Do not represent meaningless design-layer groups.

### `component`

A reusable or conceptually reusable UI composition.

Examples:
- metric card;
- profile header;
- product row;
- primary button component.

A component may be source-declared or inferred from repeated structure.

### `control`

An interactive UI element.

Examples:
- button;
- textbox;
- checkbox;
- slider;
- tab;
- menu item.

`role` should describe the control class when known.

`semanticRole` can describe purpose when supported, e.g. `primaryAction`, `destructiveAction`, `searchInput`.

### `content`

Non-interactive textual or data content.

Examples:
- title;
- body copy;
- label;
- value;
- helper text.

### `asset`

A visual/media asset.

Examples:
- icon;
- illustration;
- logo;
- avatar image.

### `token`

A reusable design value or rule.

Common `category` values:
- `color`
- `spacing`
- `typography`
- `radius`
- `border`
- `elevation`
- `size`

### `state`

A transient or condition-driven presentation of a screen/component.

Examples:
- loading;
- empty;
- populated;
- error;
- disabled;
- selected.

## Relationship types

### `contains`

Structural ownership or semantic containment.

Example:

`screen.settings -> contains -> region.account`

### `instance-of`

An instance belongs to a canonical reusable component.

Example:

`component.metric-card.revenue -> instance-of -> component.metric-card`

### `variant-of`

A stable variant belongs to a canonical component family.

Example:

`component.button.destructive -> variant-of -> component.button`

Use this for design-system variants, not temporary runtime states.

### `uses-token`

A UI concept consumes a design token.

Example:

`component.metric-card -> uses-token -> token.radius.12`

### `has-state`

A screen/component has a defined presentation state.

Example:

`screen.orders -> has-state -> state.orders.empty`

### `navigates-to`

A supported interaction navigates to another known screen.

Only assert when source evidence or explicit behavior exists.

### `triggers`

A supported control interaction triggers a known action/concept.

Do not invent command names from button labels.

## Evidence kinds

### `observed`

Directly visible or inspectable.

Examples:
- button label visible in screenshot;
- 16 px gap measured from design structure.

### `declared`

Explicitly named by a source.

Examples:
- Figma component named `PrimaryButton`;
- XAML resource named `PrimaryBrush`.

### `derived`

Computed from source facts without semantic speculation.

Examples:
- repeated exact color value;
- geometric parent-child relationship;
- normalized equivalent color representation.

### `inferred`

Semantic interpretation produced by reasoning.

Examples:
- three visually identical cards likely share one component;
- a visually prominent button appears to be the primary action.

Every inference requires confidence and rationale.

## Partial knowledge

A graph is allowed to be incomplete.

Use `unresolved` for material ambiguity rather than creating fictional behavior.
